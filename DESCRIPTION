Description: BBM can be applied directly to the IP and input data matrices for m6A co-methylation mining, avoiding the problem of introducing noise or information distortion of traditional methods, which require the IP and input data matrices to be first approximated into methylation levels.
    It can also be used for pattern mining of data that follows a beta-binomial mixture distribution.If you use BBM for other types of data mining, the input matrices a and b must be numeric matrices.
